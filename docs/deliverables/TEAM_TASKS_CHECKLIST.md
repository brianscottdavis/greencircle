# Team Tasks Checklist

A simple task list based on the process. Use the blank column to tick off, add notes, or say who’s doing what.

| Task / Question | ✓ / Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Step 1 — Clarify the Constraints** | |
| What are we solving? | Example: Helping local people understand, track, and improve how they handle waste — stuff like recycling contamination, landfill, and litter — through a website or app. |
| Who are we designing for? | Example: Local residents (different ages, backgrounds, and tech confidence); some are already into sustainability, others need a nudge; they care about the environment and their community. |
| What does success look like according to the spec? | Example: Designed for real community members, not just students; good UX thinking; proof you thought about real users; makes sense and everyone can use it; clear links to Computing Technology. |
| **Step 2 — Lock the Core Idea** | |
| Project name decided? | GreenCircle — a community-focused waste and sustainability platform. |
| Purpose defined? | Example: Let residents see waste data, report issues, join challenges, and make better recycling choices; help council and crew do their jobs. |
| Target users identified? | Example: Resident, Field Crew Member, Sustainability Ambassador, Council Administrator (each gets their own dashboard and tasks). |
| Tone agreed (community-focused, formal, playful)? | Example: Community-focused — encouraging, helpful, and practical; friendly but still clear. |
| **Step 3 — Anchor Everything to the Spec** | |
| Required deliverables listed? | *What do we have to do vs what would be cool? If we run out of time, what comes first?* |
| Explain the issue | *How do we tell the waste story so people get it? What way of explaining it will work best?* |
| Show UX features and user journeys | *Which journeys matter most to show? Just reporting? Challenges? Something else?* |
| Demonstrate how the design meets community needs | *What does "community needs" actually mean here — easy to use, works offline, council can see what’s happening, or something else?* |
| **Step 4 — Document Thinking Before Designing** | |
| Foundation document created? | *One shared doc or separate bits? Who’s responsible for keeping it up to date?* |
| Actors defined? | *Resident, crew, admin — is that everyone, or are we missing someone (e.g. ambassadors, carers, schools)?* |
| User stories written? | *A user story = one goal from the user’s point of view: "As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]." How many do we need? One per actor or just the main user?* |
| Core journeys mapped? | *A user journey = the steps someone takes to get something done (e.g. open app → report issue → get confirmation). Which one do we map first — reporting, challenges, dashboard?* |
| Prototype scope documented? | *What’s in and what’s out for v1? When do we stop adding stuff and start building?* |
| Design thinking stages captured? | *Where does this go — the main doc, a separate log, or notes all over the place?* |
| **Step 5 — Apply Design Thinking Explicitly** | |
| Empathise — user profiles documented? | *Do we have real research or are we guessing from the brief? Should we say that in the presentation?* |
| Define — challenge statement written? | *Can we agree on one clear problem statement, or will we have different ways of saying it?* |
| Ideate — ideas brainstormed? | *Brainstorm alone first or as a group? How do we avoid getting stuck on the first idea?* |
| Ideate — rationale for chosen ideas documented? | *Why did we pick this over other ideas? Do we actually know, or are we making up reasons afterwards?* |
| Prototype — decisions recorded? | *Which decisions do we need to write down why, and which are just "we went with it"?* |
| Test — improvements after feedback noted? | *Who tests, when, and how do we record feedback? Will we have time to fix things and try again?* |
| Present — evidence compiled? | *What can we show as proof — screenshots, quotes, journey maps, something else?* |
| **Step 6 — Map User Journeys Before Screens** | |
| Key journeys written out step-by-step? | |
| Screens follow the journey, not the other way round? | |
| **Step 7 — Design the Click-Through Prototype** | |
| Problem context shown? | |
| Key features shown? | |
| At least one full journey works end-to-end? | |
| Accessibility thought about? | |
| Clearly helps the community? | |
| **Step 8 — Structure the Presentation** | |
| Slide outline created before building? | |
| The waste problem — covered? | |
| Why it matters — covered? | |
| Key UX features — covered? | |
| Detailed user journey — covered? | |
| How the design meets community needs — covered? | |
| Evidence of design thinking — covered? | |
| **Step 9 — Establish Simple, Consistent Branding** | |
| Logo defined? | |
| Colours defined? | |
| Typography (fonts) defined? | |
| Branding used across prototype, slides, and docs? | |
| **Final Check** | |
| Clear reasoning shown? | |
| Good UX thinking obvious? | |
| Clear that you followed the design process? | |
| Finished, working prototype or site delivered? | |
