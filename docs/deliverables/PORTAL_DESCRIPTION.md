## What It Is

A single web app where people can:

- **Residents** — See collection schedules, report issues (overflow, contamination, missed pickups), book bulky pickups, join community challenges, and keep track of their household waste habits
- **Field crew** — View their job queue, complete assigned tasks, and plan routes
- **Council admins** — Manage jobs, challenges, users, announcements, and view engagement metrics
- **Sustainability ambassadors** — Run and promote community challenges

Everyone logs in through the same login page; the app sends you to the right dashboard based on your role.
