---

## Slide-by-Slide: Content & Notes

### Slide 1 — Title

**On slide:**
- Project title: *GreenCircle — Community Waste Management & Sustainability Platform*
- Team names (3 students)
- Date
- Optional: GreenCircle logo or simple icon

**Slide notes:**
- Introduce the team and project in one sentence.
- "We designed a digital platform to help local residents understand, report on, and improve waste management in our community."

---

### Slide 2 — The Problem

**On slide:**
- Headline: *The Waste Management Issue*
- 3–4 bullet points, e.g.:
  - Recycling contamination (wrong items in bins)
  - Landfill overflow and limited local capacity
  - Littering and illegal dumping
  - Confusion about collection schedules and rules
- Optional: 1–2 stats or a simple diagram (e.g. contamination rate, landfill growth)

**Slide notes:**
- Describe the local context: urban, regional, or remote community.
- Explain why these problems matter for residents (fines, service cuts, environmental impact).
- "Our research showed that [X]% of households are confused about what goes where."
- Reference interview quotes if available.

---

### Slide 3 — Target Users

**On slide:**
- Headline: *Who We Designed For*
- Segments from spec (keep brief):
  - **Demographic:** Mixed ages (teens to seniors), varied digital literacy
  - **Behavioural:** Different engagement levels with recycling
  - **Psychometric:** Motivated by environment or community; prefer simple, practical info
  - **Geographic:** Urban, regional, remote; some with limited internet
- Optional: 1–2 persona names/photos as visual anchors

**Slide notes:**
- Expand each segment with findings from research.
- "Persona Maria, 68, is comfortable with basic apps but needs large text and clear steps."
- "Persona James, 16, is motivated by challenges and wants to see his impact."
- Explain why audience segmentation mattered for design decisions.

### Slide 4 — Core Features

**On slide:**
- Headline: *Key Features*
- 6–8 feature blocks (icon + short label):
  1. Community Dashboard (schedules, challenges, progress)
  2. Waste Reporting (overflow, contamination, missed pickup)
  3. Sorting Guides (what goes where)
  4. Challenges & Gamification (points, milestones)
  5. Noticeboard (local updates)
  6. Offline Mode (downloadable guides)
  7. Admin View (engagement trends, announcements)
- Keep each to one line.

**Slide notes:**
- For each feature: one sentence on why it was included and how it addresses a user need.
- "Reporting was prioritised because residents told us they didn't know how to flag overflowing bins."
- "Offline mode supports users in areas with unreliable internet."

---

### Slide 5 — User Journey 1: Report an Issue

**On slide:**
- Headline: *User Journey: Report Waste Issue*
- Simple flow (4–5 steps): e.g. Login → Dashboard → Reports → New Report → Select type → Add details → Submit
- Screenshot from web prototype for 1–2 key screens (e.g. report form)
- Optional: numbered steps with arrows

**Slide notes:**
- Walk through the flow step by step.
- "The resident lands on the dashboard, sees 'Report an issue' as a prominent action."
- "We kept the form short—type, location, description—because users said they need to report quickly."
- Mention any usability findings (e.g. "Users initially missed the location field; we added a placeholder").

---

### Slide 6 — User Journey 2: Join a Challenge

**On slide:**
- Headline: *User Journey: Join a Community Challenge*
- Flow: Browse challenges → View details → Join → Log progress → See impact
- Screenshot(s) from prototype (challenge list, progress view)

**Slide notes:**
- Explain how challenges encourage engagement.
- "We chose 'Plastic-Free Week' as the example because it's achievable and has clear milestones."
- "The progress view shows contribution to community goals so users see collective impact."

---

### Slide 7 — Design Decisions & UX Principles

**On slide:**
- Headline: *Design Decisions*
- 3–4 decisions with brief rationale, e.g.:
  - **Clear navigation:** Main actions on dashboard; minimal clicks for reporting
  - **Plain language:** Avoid jargon; use terms residents use ("general waste" not "MSW")
  - **Accessibility:** Large touch targets, high contrast, screen-reader friendly
  - **Offline-first for guides:** Downloadable content for low-connectivity areas

**Slide notes:**
- For each decision: what principle it follows (consistency, feedback, error prevention, etc.).
- "We applied Nielsen's visibility principle by putting 'Report' and 'Book' above the fold."
- "Plain language came directly from user research—residents didn't understand 'contamination'."

---

### Slide 8 — How the Design Meets Community Needs

**On slide:**
- Headline: *Meeting Community Needs*
- Map to project goals (spec §46–60):
  - **Awareness:** Guides and scenario content
  - **Accessibility:** Simple flows, i18n, offline support
  - **Engagement:** Challenges, noticeboard, feedback channels
  - **Data-informed:** Charts and progress views
  - **Behaviour change:** Step-by-step guidance, motivation through gamification

**Slide notes:**
- Tie each goal to a concrete design element.
- "Accessibility: we tested with users who have low vision; we increased contrast and font sizes."
- "Engagement: the noticeboard keeps residents informed; challenges give them a reason to return."

### Slide 9 — Success Criteria

**On slide:**
- Headline: *Success Criteria Check*
- Table or checklist:
  | Criterion | ✓ |
  |-----------|---|
  | Targets local community (not students) | ✓ |
  | UX design principles applied | ✓ |
  | User-centred design thinking | ✓ |
  | Logical, accessible, realistic | ✓ |
  | Computing Technology concepts | ✓ |
- Brief evidence for each (1 line)

**Slide notes:**
- "Targets community: our personas are residents and council staff, not students."
- "UX principles: we used consistency in navigation, feedback on form submission, error prevention on required fields."
- "Computing Technology: we applied human–computer interaction concepts, usability heuristics, and audience segmentation."

---

### Slide 10 — Summary

**On slide:**
- Headline: *Summary*
- 3–4 bullet takeaways:
  - Problem addressed
  - Main features delivered
  - How design meets needs
  - Next steps (e.g. pilot with council, iterate from feedback)
- Thank you / Q&A

**Slide notes:**
- Closing statement: what the team learned.
- Anticipate questions: "How would you test with real users?" "What would you change with more time?"
- Suggest one concrete next step (e.g. "We'd run a 4-week pilot with 20 households").

## General Tips

- **Slides:** Minimal text; use visuals (screenshots, diagrams, icons).
- **Notes:** Full sentences for presenter; can be longer than slide content.
- **Timing:** ~1–2 minutes per slide; 10 slides ≈ 15–20 minutes.
- **Backup:** Keep detailed research data in notes in case of questions.
